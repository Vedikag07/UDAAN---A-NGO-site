        <p style="font-size: 28px; font-weight:30px; color:#111150">Why Children?</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Over 50 % of children aged 6-18 do not go to school and 17 million children in India work as per official estimates. Each and every child is meant to go to school and not work under any circumstances but unfortunately every child can be provided
            with basic let alone quality education sometimes its the family pressure to leave education an work in order to increase financial contributuion the family sometimes its because of the area they are growing where even basic of the facilities
            cannot be provided poverty is one of the main causes why only 50 percent go to school our future depends on the young generation each and evry child deserves the quality education which can keep his/her future secure providing education and
            health faciliites and considering their mental health as well as spreading menstrual awareness all over isnt a easy tasks because the number that calls for help is huge but definitely not impossible even minute help will help bring a significant
            and visible change in a persons life</p>
