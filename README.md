The website for the NGO UDAAN, established in 2023, aims to enhance the lives of deprived children by providing a healthy academic environment and essential health facilities. The site includes sections such as About Us, The Team, Contacts, Our Work, Our Services (including Education, Healthcare, and Food), Donate, Donation, Payment Gateway, and FAQ. It offers the ability to make donations for various causes under one umbrella, real-time payments using UPI and credit/debit cards through the API of Razor-pay, and the ability to track payments using the payment gateway portal. The website also features interactive posters to brief users about upcoming events of the NGO. The vision and mission of the NGO emphasize the protection of children's rights, social justice, and equality, ultimately aiming to change the future of deprived children into self-reliant youths. The website leverages technology to connect more people willing to support those in need and facilitate support through interactive features.
